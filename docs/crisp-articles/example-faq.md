# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are answers to the most common questions about Cursive.

## General Questions

### What is Cursive?

Cursive is a lead marketplace platform that helps you identify anonymous website visitors and convert them into qualified leads. We use AudienceLab's SuperPixel technology to track visitor behavior and enrich lead data with business information.

### How does Cursive work?

1. **Track**: We identify visitors to your website using AudienceLab integration
2. **Enrich**: We add business data (company, industry, location, contact info)
3. **Score**: Each lead gets a deliverability score based on data quality
4. **Deliver**: Leads matching your preferences are delivered to your dashboard
5. **Connect**: You reach out and book meetings!

### How much does Cursive cost?

We offer several pricing tiers:

| Package | Credits | Price | Per Lead |

## Lead Quality

### What makes a lead "qualified"?

A lead is considered qualified when it:

- Meets your targeting preferences (industry, location)
- Has a deliverability score of 60+ (out of 100)
- Includes either a business email OR phone number
- Comes from an authentic/form event OR meets lead-worthiness criteria

### How is the deliverability score calculated?

The score is based on several factors:

- **Valid ESP email** (40 points): Email verified by ESP
- **Valid email** (30 points): Email passes validation
- **Recent activity** (30 points): Last seen within 30 days
- **Skip trace data** (15 points): Enhanced contact information
- **Phone number** (10 points): Valid phone available
- **Business email** (5 points): Corporate email address

Maximum score: 100 points

### Can I reject low-quality leads?

Yes! You can reject any lead from the **My Leads** page. Rejected leads will refund your credit (if applicable).

## Credits and Billing

### How do credits work?

- Each qualified lead delivered costs **1 credit**

### What happens when I run out of credits?
