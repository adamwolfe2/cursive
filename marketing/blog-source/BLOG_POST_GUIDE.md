# How to Create AEO-Optimized Blog Posts

This guide shows you how to write blog posts optimized for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) using the Cursive blog template system.

## Quick Start Checklist

Before writing, ensure you have:

- [ ] Target keyword identified
- [ ] Search intent understood
- [ ] Competitor content reviewed
- [ ] "People Also Ask" questions collected
- [ ] Brand voice guidelines reviewed
- [ ] Author information prepared
- [ ] Featured image ready (1200x630px minimum)

## Blog Post Structure

### 1. Title (H1)

**Format**: Question-based or benefit-driven

**Good Examples**:
- "How Does Visitor Identification Work? [Complete Guide]"
- "The Complete Guide to B2B Lead Generation in 2026"
- "10 Ways to Identify Anonymous Website Visitors"

**Bad Examples**:
- "Visitor Identification" (too vague)
- "Revolutionary New Approach to Lead Gen" (hype without substance)
- "Everything You Need to Know About Marketing" (too broad)

**Best Practices**:
- Include target keyword
- Keep under 60 characters for SEO
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use power words (Complete, Essential, Proven, Ultimate)
- Match search intent

### 2. Meta Description

**Length**: 150-160 characters

**Template**: "[Verb] [benefit]. Learn [specific outcome] with [specificity]. [Social proof or stat]."

**Example**:
"Learn how visitor identification reveals 70% of anonymous traffic. Discover proven strategies to turn website visitors into qualified B2B leads."

**Best Practices**:
- Include target keyword
- Clear value proposition
- Call to action implied
- Use active voice
- Include numbers when relevant

### 3. Introduction (First 100 words)

**Purpose**: Answer the main question immediately

**Structure**:
1. **Opening sentence**: Direct answer to title question
2. **Context (1-2 sentences)**: Why this matters
3. **Promise (1-2 sentences)**: What reader will learn

**Example**:
```
Visitor identification reveals which companies are browsing your website—
even when they don't fill out a form. For B2B companies, this transforms
anonymous traffic into actionable sales intelligence.

In this guide, you'll learn how visitor identification works, why 70%
identification rates are possible, and how to implement it in under 5 minutes.
By the end, you'll understand exactly how to turn your website into an active
lead generation engine.
```

**AEO Optimization**:
- Answer the question in first 40-60 words
- Use definition format for "What is" queries
- Include target keyword naturally
- Write for featured snippet extraction

### 4. Body Content

#### H2 Sections (Main Topics)

Use question-based H2s that match "People Also Ask" queries:

**Good H2s**:
- "What is Visitor Identification?"
- "How Does Visitor Identification Work?"
- "Why Visitor Identification Matters for B2B"
- "How to Implement Visitor Identification"

**Bad H2s**:
- "Overview"
- "Background"
- "Introduction"
- "Details"

#### H3 Subsections

Break down H2 topics into specific subtopics:

**Example**:
```
## How Does Visitor Identification Work?

### 1. IP Address Lookup
[Content about IP matching]

### 2. Reverse DNS Lookup
[Content about DNS records]

### 3. Behavioral Fingerprinting
[Content about tracking patterns]
```

#### Content Within Sections

**Paragraph Structure**:
- First sentence: Direct answer or key point
- Supporting sentences: Evidence, examples, details
- Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences max

**Example (Good)**:
```
Visitor identification achieves 60-70% accuracy for B2B traffic.
Business IP addresses are easier to match because companies typically
own dedicated IP ranges. The remaining 30% includes residential IPs,
VPN users, and mobile traffic that can't be reliably identified.
```

**Example (Bad)**:
```
The accuracy of visitor identification depends on various factors and
can vary significantly depending on the type of traffic you receive,
with B2B traffic generally performing better than consumer traffic due
to the nature of business IP addresses and the availability of data.
```

### 5. Lists and Bullets

**When to Use Lists**:
- Multiple related items
- Step-by-step instructions
- Pros and cons
- Feature comparisons
- Key takeaways

**Numbered Lists**:
Use for sequential steps or ranked items:
```
1. **Install tracking pixel**: Add JavaScript to your site
2. **Configure settings**: Set up identification rules
3. **Connect CRM**: Sync to Salesforce or HubSpot
4. **Test and verify**: Confirm data is flowing correctly
```

**Bulleted Lists**:
Use for non-sequential items:
```
Visitor identification helps you:
- Identify companies actively researching your product
- Prioritize sales outreach based on engagement
- Retarget anonymous visitors with relevant ads
- Build more accurate attribution models
```

**List Best Practices**:
- Bold the key term in each item
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Limit to 3-7 items per list
- Add brief explanation (1-2 sentences) if needed

### 6. Statistics and Data

**Format**: Source → Statistic → Interpretation

**Example**:
```
According to HubSpot's 2024 State of Marketing report, 61% of marketers
say generating traffic and leads is their top challenge. This explains why
visitor identification has become essential—it helps convert existing
traffic rather than requiring more ad spend.
```

**Best Practices**:
- Always cite sources
- Use specific numbers (not "many" or "most")
- Include timeframe (2024, Q1 2025, etc.)
- Explain what the stat means
- Link to original source

**Cursive Stats to Use**:
- 70% visitor identification rate
- 220M+ consumer profiles
- 140M+ business profiles
- 450B+ monthly intent signals
- 200+ native integrations

### 7. Examples and Use Cases

**Structure**:
```
### [Use Case Name]

[1-2 sentence setup of the scenario]

**Example**: [Specific, concrete example]

[Outcome or result]
```

**Example**:
```
### Sales Prioritization

Instead of cold calling from static lists, your sales team focuses on
companies actively showing interest.

**Example**: If a target account visits your pricing page three times in
one week and downloads a case study, that's a strong signal they're
evaluating vendors.

Your sales team receives an alert and can reach out while the company
is still in active research mode—dramatically increasing connection rates.
```

### 8. Comparison Tables

Use for "X vs Y" content or feature comparisons:

```markdown
| Feature | Traditional Analytics | Visitor Identification |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Traffic visibility | Anonymous sessions | Named companies |
| Data depth | Pageviews, time on site | Company details, contacts |
| Actionability | Aggregate insights | Individual account targeting |
| Best for | Overall trends | Sales outreach |
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep columns to 2-4 max
- Use consistent formatting
- Bold key differences
- Include "Best for" row

### 9. FAQ Section

**Purpose**: Capture long-tail keywords and "People Also Ask" queries

**Structure**:
```
## Frequently Asked Questions

### [Question exactly as users search it]?

[Direct answer in first sentence]. [Supporting details in 2-3 sentences].
[Related information or link if applicable].
```

**Question Selection**:
1. Check "People Also Ask" in Google
2. Review competitor FAQs
3. Pull from customer support tickets
4. Use Answer The Public for long-tail queries

**Number of FAQs**: 5-10 questions

**Example**:
```
### How accurate is visitor identification?

For B2B traffic, visitor identification typically achieves 60-70% accuracy.
Cursive identifies up to 70% of business visitors. The remaining 30% includes
residential IPs, VPN users, and mobile carrier traffic that cannot be
reliably matched to companies.
```

**FAQ Best Practices**:
- Use natural question phrasing
- Answer in 50-100 words
- Include target keyword variations
- Link to related content
- Generate FAQ schema automatically

### 10. Internal Linking

**Where to Link**:
- First mention of related topic
- Within relevant context
- In FAQ answers
- "Related posts" section

**Anchor Text Best Practices**:
- Descriptive (not "click here")
- Natural within sentence
- Include target keyword of destination
- Vary anchor text

**Example**:
```
Good: "Learn more about [intent data strategies](#) in our complete guide."
Bad: "Click [here](#) to learn more."
```

**Linking Strategy**:
- 5-10 internal links per post
- Link to cornerstone content
- Create topic clusters
- Link newer posts to older posts

### 11. Call-to-Action Placement

**Recommended Placements**:

1. **After introduction** (optional, soft CTA)
2. **After first major section** (demo/trial CTA)
3. **Mid-content** (newsletter or resource)
4. **Before FAQs** (trial/pricing CTA)
5. **After related posts** (demo CTA)

**CTA Variety**:
- Alternate between demo, trial, pricing, newsletter
- Match CTA to content topic
- Use custom CTAs for specific offers

**Example Placement**:
```
[Content about implementation]

<CTABox
  variant="trial"
  customTitle="Ready to identify your visitors?"
  customDescription="Install our tracking pixel in 5 minutes and start seeing which companies are visiting your site."
/>

[More content continues]
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Cursive Voice Principles

**1. Clear Over Clever**
```
❌ "We're the secret sauce for your growth recipe"
✅ "We identify anonymous website visitors and turn them into qualified leads"
```

**2. Specific Over Vague**
```
❌ "Dramatically increase your lead generation"
✅ "Identify 70% of your anonymous website traffic and convert them into qualified leads"
```

**3. Benefits Over Features**
```
❌ "Cursive uses AI-powered identity resolution"
✅ "Know exactly which companies visited your pricing page this week—so you can reach out while they're still interested"
```

**4. Conversational Over Corporate**
```
❌ "Organizations leveraging our platform experience significant improvements"
✅ "When you can see who's visiting your site, you stop guessing and start converting"
```

**5. Honest Over Hype**
```
❌ "The #1 revolutionary game-changing platform"
✅ "The AI-powered platform that identifies 70% of your anonymous website visitors"
```

### Sentence Structure

**Length Variation**:
- Short (5-10 words): Emphasis, key points
- Medium (15-20 words): Standard explanation
- Long (20-25 words): Complex ideas (use sparingly)

**Example**:
```
Visitor identification reveals anonymous traffic. [SHORT]

For B2B companies, this means you can see which businesses are
researching your product. [MEDIUM]

Instead of waiting for prospects to fill out forms, you identify
them immediately when they land on your site and can reach out
while they're still actively evaluating solutions. [LONG]
```

### Words to Use

**Action Verbs**:
identify, reveal, uncover, discover, build, create, activate, launch,
trigger, integrate, sync, connect

**For Visitor ID**:
identify, reveal, uncover, see, discover, track, recognize

**For Audiences**:
build, create, segment, filter, define, target

**For Campaigns**:
activate, launch, trigger, send, deploy

**For Integrations**:
integrate, sync, connect, link, combine

### Words to Avoid

**Corporate Jargon**:
- ❌ leverage, utilize, synergize
- ❌ revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive
- ❌ seamless, turnkey, frictionless
- ❌ robust, scalable (unless specific)
- ❌ innovative, cutting-edge (overused)

**Qualifiers** (remove or use sparingly):
- almost, very, really, quite, just, actually

**Passive Voice**:
- ❌ "Visitors are identified by Cursive"
- ✅ "Cursive identifies visitors"
