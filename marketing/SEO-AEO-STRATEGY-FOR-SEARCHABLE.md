- **Website Visitor Identification**: Reveals 70% of anonymous website visitors with name, email, company, title
- **Lead Enrichment**: 220M+ consumer profiles + 140M+ business profiles with verified contact data
- **Intent Data**: 450B+ monthly intent signals across 30,000+ commercial categories
- **AI-Powered Outreach**: Automated multi-channel sequences (email, LinkedIn, SMS)

### Our Unique Positioning
**We are the ONLY platform that combines visitor identification + intent data + lead enrichment + automated multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, SMS, direct mail) in one place.** Every competitor only does a piece of this:

- RB2B/Warmly do visitor ID but NOT outbound automation
- Apollo/Instantly do outbound but NOT visitor identification
- 6sense/Demandbase do intent but are enterprise-only ($60k+/yr) and lack direct mail
- Clearbit (now HubSpot Breeze) does enrichment but NOT visitor ID or outbound
- Bombora does intent data ONLY, no action layer

### What We Need From Searchable
We need to be the **#1 ranking page** for our core offer. We want Searchable to help us:
1. Rank #1 for our highest-value keywords
2. Get cited by AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews)
3. Build a content engine that compounds over time
4. Dominate competitor comparison searches
5. Fix anything that's broken or holding us back

31. **Should we prioritize BOFU content (comparisons, alternatives) or TOFU content (educational guides)?** Research says comparison pages convert at 8.43% — should we go all-in?

32. **We're missing "What is X" educational content for our core terms.** Should we create dedicated pages for:
   - "What is Website Visitor Identification?"
   - "What is B2B Intent Data?"
   - "What is an AI SDR?"
   - "What is Lead Enrichment?"

40. **Should we syndicate our blog posts anywhere?** Medium, LinkedIn articles, industry publications?

41. **How important is LinkedIn thought leadership for SEO?** Microsoft Copilot saw 25x growth and pulls from LinkedIn.

42. **Should we be posting on Reddit strategically?** Perplexity cites Reddit 46.7% of the time.

---

## 8. QUESTIONS FOR SEARCHABLE - TECHNICAL SEO

### Current Issues
43. **We don't have a robots.txt file.** Can you help us create one? We need to block /popup-test and any internal test pages.

44. **Some pages have thin content** (/contact, /data-access, /case-studies). Should we expand these or noindex them?

45. **Our blog metadata is inconsistent** — some posts use generateMetadata(), others use direct Metadata objects. Does this matter for SEO?

46. **Are our structured data implementations correct?** Some pages embed schema in the `other` metadata object as JSON strings. Is this effective?

47. **What's our Core Web Vitals score?** Are there performance issues hurting our rankings?

48. **Do we have any crawl errors, broken links, or 404s?** Can you run a full technical audit?

49. **Is our sitemap.ts correctly configured?** It dynamically generates priorities and change frequencies. Is this optimal?

50. **Should we implement hreflang tags?** We primarily target US but have some international visitors.

### Site Architecture
51. **Is our URL structure optimal?** We have /blog/X, /industries/X, but no /compare/X or /use-cases/X. What should we add?

52. **How should we structure our internal linking?** Currently, blog posts link to product pages, but product pages don't always link to relevant blog posts.

53. **Should we create pillar pages + topic clusters?** Like a "Website Visitor Identification" pillar page that links to all related blog posts and comparison pages?

54. **Do we need breadcrumb navigation on more pages?** Currently only on industry and solution pages.

### Speed & Performance
55. **Our marketing site is Next.js on Vercel.** Are there any Next.js-specific SEO optimizations we're missing?

56. **We use framer-motion for animations.** Is the JavaScript bundle affecting our SEO performance?

## 10. QUESTIONS FOR SEARCHABLE - PROGRAMMATIC SEO

### Scalable Page Templates

67. **Should we build programmatic use-case pages?** `/use-cases/outbound-sales/`, `/use-cases/abm/`, `/use-cases/product-led-growth/`, etc.

68. **Can we templatize our competitor comparison pages?** Create a component that generates consistent, SEO-optimized comparison pages at scale.

69. **What's the minimum content quality for programmatic pages to rank?** 300 words? 500? 1,000?

70. **How do we prevent programmatic pages from being flagged as thin/duplicate content?** Each page needs enough unique content.

### Scale Strategy
71. **If we could publish 50 programmatic pages in the next 3 months, what should they be?** Prioritize by keyword volume and conversion potential.

72. **How do we handle schema markup at scale?** Each programmatic page needs proper structured data.

## 13. AEO BEST PRACTICES WE'VE LEARNED

### The New Reality (2026)
- **73% of B2B buyers** now use AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity) in their research
- **25% of organic search traffic** has shifted to AI chatbots
- **93% of Google AI Mode searches** end without any click
- AI-referred traffic converts at **2-3x higher rates** than traditional search
- Only **11% of domains** are cited by both ChatGPT and Perplexity

### Platform-Specific Citation Sources
| AI Platform | Top Citation Sources | Optimization Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** | Wikipedia, encyclopedic content (47.9%) | Definitive, authoritative, structured content |
| **Perplexity** | Reddit (46.7%), niche forums | Community mentions, authentic discussion |
| **Google AI Overviews** | YouTube, multi-modal content (23.3%) | Video content, visual assets |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Enterprise sources, LinkedIn (25x growth) | LinkedIn thought leadership |

### Tactical Recommendations
1. **Structure content as Q&A blocks**: 40-70 word answer blocks for each key question
2. **Lead with concise definitions**: Opening paragraphs answering the query upfront get cited 67% more
3. **Include original data tables**: Pages with original data earn 4.1x more AI citations
4. **Add specific statistics**: Boosts citation performance by 5.5%+
5. **Use clear H2/H3/bullet structures**: 40% more likely to be cited
6. **Consistent entity naming**: Always refer to product the same way
7. **Build presence on cited platforms**: G2, TrustRadius, Gartner Peer Insights, Reddit
8. **Comprehensive schema markup**: FAQPage, HowTo, Article, SoftwareApplication, Product

## 14. WHAT WE THINK IS BROKEN / NEEDS HELP

### Critical Issues
1. **No robots.txt** — search engines have no explicit crawler guidance
2. **Missing metadata on /integrations page** — no title/description export
3. **Case studies is a "Coming Soon" placeholder** — zero SEO value, wasting crawl budget
4. **No G2/TrustRadius presence** — critical for AI citations in 2026

### High Priority
5. **Thin content on /contact, /data-access** — needs substance or noindex
6. **Missing author/date metadata** on some blog posts
7. **Inconsistent blog metadata patterns** — generates vs direct Metadata
8. **No dedicated intent data landing page** — intent heavily promoted but scattered
9. **Industry pages may not have explicit metadata** — potentially inheriting from layout
10. **No "What is X" educational content** — missing entire category of AEO-valuable pages

### Medium Priority
11. **Same AggregateRating (4.8/5, 127 reviews) used across multiple pages** — should vary
12. **Internal linking could be stronger** — product pages don't link back to relevant blog posts
13. **No comparison hub** to concentrate topical authority
14. **No programmatic SEO** — missing huge opportunity for integration pages, use-case pages
15. **We have 5 competitor comparisons but need 20+** — massive content gap

### Things We're Unsure About
16. **Is our Next.js/Vercel setup SEO-optimal?** Dynamic rendering, hydration, JavaScript impact?
17. **Are our framer-motion animations hurting Core Web Vitals?**
18. **Is our current domain authority competitive enough to rank for our target keywords?**
19. **Are we targeting the right keywords or chasing terms that are too competitive?**
20. **Should we invest in video content for Google AI Overviews?** YouTube is 23.3% of citations.
