## User Journey (What to Show When)

## Onboarding Checklist (3 Steps Max)

1. Choose your path
2. Set up payment
3. Take first action

**Don't:** Ask for service areas (confusing for B2B SaaS)
**Don't:** Have 5+ checklist items (overwhelming)
**Do:** Focus on getting to value fast

## Copywriting Rules

### BEFORE → AFTER Examples

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "AI Intent Systems" | "Identify Website Visitors" |
| "Build intent systems" | "Set up automated outreach" |
| "Queries" | "Lead Search" |
| "Service tiers" | "Choose your approach" |
| "Purchase credits" | "Add $100 to get started" |
| "Cursive Data" | "Custom Lead Lists (500+ leads/month)" |

### Writing Principles
1. **Concrete over abstract** - "Identify visitors" not "AI systems"
2. **Benefits over features** - "Book meetings" not "Send emails"
3. **User language over jargon** - "Lead search" not "Queries"
4. **Specific over generic** - "500+ leads" not "Custom lists"

---

## CTAs by User Type

### DIY Users (Tech-Savvy)
- Primary: "Start Free Trial"
- Secondary: "Install Tracking"

### Buyer Users (Less Technical)
- Primary: "Browse Marketplace"
- Secondary: "Get Done-For-You"

### Enterprise Users (Need Custom)
- Primary: "Book Strategy Call"
- Secondary: "See Platform Demo"

---

## The 10-Second Test

Users should be able to answer these in 10 seconds:

1. **What is Cursive?**
   → Identifies visitors, enriches data, automates outreach

2. **What should I do next?**
   → Choose: Marketplace, Tracking, or Done-For-You

3. **Is this for me?**
   → B2B SaaS teams who want to convert traffic into meetings

If they can't answer these, the messaging needs work.

## Stats to Show (Credibility)

- **70%** - Visitor identification rate
- **220M+** - Consumer profiles
- **140M+** - Business profiles

## When to Show Upsells

**DON'T:**
- Show immediately to free users

**DO:**

- Use clear benefits ("500+ leads/month")
- Make it contextual to their activity

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Too many options (show 3, not 5+)
2. Abstract language ("AI systems" vs "identify visitors")
3. Feature lists without benefits
4. Jargon in navigation ("queries", "tiers")
5. Overwhelming new users
6. No clear next steps
7. Generic CTAs ("Learn More")
